Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide to create a new **Admin panel section in Strapi** by generating a custom plugin using TypeScript:

---

### **1. Install the Plugin Generator**
Run the following command to install the Strapi plugin generator:
```bash
npx @strapi/sdk-plugin@latest init my-plugin
```
This will scaffold a new plugin in the `./plugins/my-plugin` directory.

---

### **2. Configure Plugin Details**
When running the command above, you‚Äôll be prompted to provide the following details:

- **Plugin Name**: The name of your plugin (e.g., `my-plugin`).
- **Description**: A brief description of what the plugin does.
- **Author**: Your name or organization.
- **License**: The type of license you want to use (e.g., MIT).
- **Language**: Choose `TypeScript` for this project.
- **Template**: Optionally select a template (default is fine unless a specific template is needed).

Strapi will create the boilerplate code for your plugin.

---

### **3. Navigate to the Plugin Folder**
Move to the generated plugin directory:
```bash
cd ./plugins/my-plugin
```

---

### **4. Register the Plugin in the Admin Panel**
Update the `admin/src/index.ts` file to configure the admin panel section:
```typescript
// import { StrapiAdminPlugin } from '@strapi/types';
import PluginIcon from './icons/PluginIcon';
const myPlugin: any = {
  register(app: any) {
    app.addMenuLink({
      to: '/plugins/my-plugin',
      icon: PluginIcon, // 'PluginIcon' Replace with the desired icon
      intlLabel: {
        id: 'my-plugin.label',
        defaultMessage: 'My Plugin',
      },
      Component: async () => import('./pages/App'), // Path to your custom React component
      permissions: [], // Add permissions if required
    });
  },
};

export default myPlugin;

```

---

### **5. Create a Custom Page for the Admin Panel**
Inside the `admin/src/pages` directory, create a new file named `App.tsx`:
```tsx
import React from 'react';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to My Plugin</h1>
      <p>This is your custom admin panel section.</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

---

admin/src/icons/PluginIcon.tsx

```
import React from 'react'

export default function PluginIcon() {
    return (
        <svg className="w-6 h-6 text-gray-800 dark:text-white" aria-hidden="true" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" fill="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
            <path d="M13.5 2c-.178 0-.356.013-.492.022l-.074.005a1 1 0 0 0-.934.998V11a1 1 0 0 0 1 1h7.975a1 1 0 0 0 .998-.934l.005-.074A7.04 7.04 0 0 0 22 10.5 8.5 8.5 0 0 0 13.5 2Z" />
            <path d="M11 6.025a1 1 0 0 0-1.065-.998 8.5 8.5 0 1 0 9.038 9.039A1 1 0 0 0 17.975 13H11V6.025Z" />
        </svg>

    )
}
```

---

### **7. Build the Plugin**
After making changes, rebuild the admin panel to reflect your new section:
```bash
npm run build
npm run watch changes 
```

---

### **8. Verify the Admin Panel**
- ``` npm run develop ``` at root strapi cms path
- Log in to your Strapi admin panel.
- You should see a new menu item labeled "My Plugin" in the sidebar.
- Clicking on it should load your custom page.

---

### **9. Extend the Plugin (Optional)**
You can enhance your plugin by adding:

- **Custom APIs**: Add controllers, services, and routes in the `./server` folder of the plugin.
- **Custom Components**: Build additional React components for complex UI needs.
- **Database Models**: Define custom schemas in the plugin‚Äôs `./server/content-types` folder.

---

### **10. Deploy Your Changes**
Once completed, test and deploy your Strapi application with the new plugin.

 

----------
# The common npm scripts used in Strapi (and other Node.js projects) to manage the development, building, and running of your project. Here‚Äôs what each command does:

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ `npm run build`
### **What it does?**
- This command **compiles and builds** the Strapi admin panel.
- It processes JavaScript, CSS, and other assets to prepare the admin panel for deployment.

### **Why do we use it?**
- Every time you make changes to the admin panel (like adding a new plugin or modifying UI components), you must rebuild it for the changes to take effect.

### **How to use it?**
Run this command inside your Strapi project root directory:
```sh
npm run build
```

### **When to use it?**
- After installing a new plugin.
- After modifying Strapi‚Äôs admin panel files.
- Before deploying the Strapi app to production.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ `npm run watch`
### **What it does?**
- It **watches** for changes in your Strapi project files and automatically **rebuilds the admin panel** whenever a change is detected.

### **Why do we use it?**
- It helps during development so that you don‚Äôt have to manually run `npm run build` every time you make a change.

### **How to use it?**
Run this command inside your Strapi project:
```sh
npm run watch
```

### **When to use it?**
- When actively developing and making frequent changes to the admin panel.
- When working on a custom plugin that modifies the UI.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ `npm run develop`
### **What it does?**
- It **starts the Strapi server in development mode**.
- The server **automatically reloads** when you change backend files.

### **Why do we use it?**
- It helps in real-time development because it restarts the server whenever you modify Strapi APIs, controllers, or services.

### **How to use it?**
Run this inside your Strapi project:
```sh
npm run develop
```

### **When to use it?**
- When developing or testing new APIs, models, or database schemas.
- When debugging backend issues.
